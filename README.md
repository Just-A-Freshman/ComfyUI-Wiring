## Environment Requirements  
A basic Python environment (version 3.4 or higher) is required. For the fully polished visual UI experience, the project relies on Flask APIs. If you only need to use the core algorithm, refer to the `core` directory or download the release file: `backend.zip`.  


## Usage  
### Method 1: In Python, once the environment is set up, simply double-click `app.py`. A command prompt window will appear—click the link in it to access the user-friendly interface.  
### Method 2: Download `dist.zip` from the releases: [click here to  download](https://github.com/Just-A-Freshman/ComfyUI-Wiring/releases/download/source_code/dist.zip) It contains the `.exe` file for Windows systems. You can use it just like in Method 1.
