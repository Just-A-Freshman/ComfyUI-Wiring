## Environment Requirements  
A basic Python environment (version 3.4 or higher) is required. For the full, visually polished UI experience, the project depends on Vue and Flask APIs. If you only need to work with the core algorithm, refer to the `core` directory or download the release file: `frontend.zip`.  


## Usage  
Once the environment is configured, simply double-click `app.py`. A command prompt window will appearâ€”click the link within it to access the user-friendly interface.
