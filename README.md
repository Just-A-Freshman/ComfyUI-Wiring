# ComfyUI-Wiring
ComfyWiring: A smart wiring assistant for ComfyUI that automatically arranges node connections to reduce clutter and improve workflow readability."

## Environment:
You need a basic Python environment (version 3.4 or higher). The project does not depend on any third-party libraries.

## Using
The main program is in main.py, and you can use it simply by modifying the file path names inside.

## Other
Currently, this project is only in its initial stage and performs well for relatively simple workflows (with around 30 nodes). When there are more nodes, the overall length of the workflow will increase significantly, and some connections will have large spans, resulting in complex and intertwined wiring of the workflow.
