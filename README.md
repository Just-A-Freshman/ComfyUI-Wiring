## Environment:
You need a basic Python environment (version 3.4 or higher). To make a beautiful UI design, the project depend on the vue and flask api. However, if you only focus on the core algorithm， see the `core` directory or download the release file: `frontend.zip`. 

## Using
After you finish configing the environment, you can use it simply by double click `app.py`, then you will see a cmd window. Click the link inside and a easyuse UI will be seen.

## If you like this project, don't be shy to give me a thumbs-up！
